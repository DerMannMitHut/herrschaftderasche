intro: "You wake to a pallid grey morning, where even silence feels like dust. Fine ash drifts through seams in the wood, sketching pale currents in the light and settling like memory on everything that remains. Cold smoke lingers in the air. Something in you knows: an old promise will stir today, and somewhere beneath the grey a crown waits for the world to breathe again."

      readable:
        description: "Beneath the grime a thin line in red charcoal emerges: a path from the hut to the ruins. Small notes whisper of detours and signs. At the edge, a shallow cut reads: 'Follow the ash where the wind rests.'"

      - Village
    description: "A village bowed beneath a soft weight of ash. Roofs sag; doors stand ajar as if listening. Water lies dark and still in the well. Old pennants hang in threads; soot and dried herbs scent the air."

  crown_returned: "With the Ashen Crown returned, you walk back into the village. People step from their doorframes, and ash begins to fall like slow snow. In your footprints the way grows clearer, as if an unseen wind were sweeping the world. Your name is spoken, and for the first time in a long while it does not sound like an echo in the dust."
